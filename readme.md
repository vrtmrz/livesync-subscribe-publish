# LiveSync Subscribe Publish

A static-site-generator runner for Self-hosted LiveSync.

Subscribe to the changes of the remote database of Self-hosted LiveSync, fetch them on the local filesystem, and run the script if the specific file has been changed!

a.k.a. (Currently) Subscribe only Filesystem-LiveSync.

## Prerequisite

- Deno required.
- This should be running near or at the same place where your CouchDB has been hosted.
  Probably uses a lot of traffic.

## How to run

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-subscribe-publish
$ cd livesync-subscribe-publish
$ cp config.sample.json config.json
$ vi config.json
$ deno run -A main.ts
```

## Tips
[obsidian-export](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) could be nice friends. I will make an integrated sample.
